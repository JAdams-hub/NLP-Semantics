# NLP-Semantics
Using Spacy to create a movie suggestion based on the users last watched movie

### Overview
The following files tests Spacy's ability to find similarities between words. Utilising the capabilities of Spacy,
we then create a program that makes a movie recommendation to a user who had last watched a movie called 'Planet Hulk'.
The watch_next.py program reads the information in movies.txt to make this recommendation.

### Installation
Open your terminal or command prompt.

#### Initializing a repository:
1. Use 'cd' to change your directory then add/type your directory to initialize the directory of which you will place the local repository.
2. Use the command 'git init'.

#### Cloning the NLP-Semantics repository:
1. Enter 'git clone https://github.com/JAdams-hub/NLP-Semantics' in your command prompt/terminal.

### Files
As mentioned earlier, the watch_next.py program reads the information in movies.txt to make this recommendation.
The Semantic.py program makes a test to see how spacy views the accuracy of specific words.
